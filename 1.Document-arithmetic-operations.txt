Arithmetic Operators:
====================
  Addition 		+
  Subtraction 		-
  Multiplication	*
  Division		/
  Remainder		%
  Increment		++  (To increment your value by one; example if x=2 then ((x++)) means x value will increase by 1 and it is 3 now.
  Decrement		--
If your data is integers then use (()) syntax to perform arithmetic operations else use bc (bash calculator).

Integer Example:
  x=4
  y=7
  ((sum=x+y))
  echo "The addition of $x and $y is: $sum"
Float/integer Example:
Note: bc calculator is a commmand to perform arithemtic operations on either integers or float numbers.
x=4.5
y=6.7
sum=$(bc<<<"scale=3;$x+$y")
echo "The addtion of $x and $y is: $sum"
