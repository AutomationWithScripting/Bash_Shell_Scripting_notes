File test operators:
--------------------

[  -d  file ]	-- It return true if the file/path  is directory  else false     
[  -f file ]    -- It return true if the file/path is a file else  false
[  -e file ]    -- It return true if the file/path is exists else  false
[  -r file ]    -- It return true if the file/path is readable else  false
[  -w file ]    -- It return true if the file/path is writable else  false
[  -x file ]    -- It return true if the file/path is executable else  false

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advanced file test operators are listed below:

    a : True if the file exists.
    b : True if the file exists and is a block special file.
    c : True if the file exists and is a character special file.
    d : True if the file exists and is a directory.
    e : True if the file exists.
    f : True if the file exists and is a regular file.
    g : True if the file exists and its SGID bit is set.
    h : True if the file exists and is a symbolic link.
    k : True if the file exists and its sticky bit is set.
    p : True if the file exists and is a named pipe (FIFO).
    r : True if the file exists and is readable.
    s : True if the file exists and has a size greater than zero.
    t : True if file descriptor is open and refers to a terminal.
    u : True if the file exists and its SUID (set user ID) bit is set.
    w : True if the file exists and is writable.
    x : True if the file exists and is executable.
    O : True if the file exists and is owned by the effective user ID.
    G : True if the file exists and is owned by the effective group ID.
    L : True if the file exists and is a symbolic link.
    N : True if the file exists and has been modified since it was last read.
    S : True if the file exists and is a socket.
